	<h1>Introduction to Javascript</h1>
    <p>we are going to concentrate on learning the fundamentals of the Javascript language.A lot of even seasoned developers “tinker” with Javascript without really understanding how the language works. That leads to viewing the language as more of a nuisance instead of a powerful tool. That is why we are going to concentrate not only on the “how” but also on the “why”, so you are empowered by the Javascript language features, not confused by them. 

We’ll cover just about everything from common language constructs and Javascript types to 
<em>objects, functions, arrays, closures, and scope isolation.</em>
